        Statement of Retained Earnings
    </p>
    <p>
        The statement of retained earnings illustrates changes to a company's retained earnings over a period of time.
        The report shows items that increase retained earnings (profit) as well as items that decrease
        retained earnings (loss and dividends). It's important to note that dividends are not an expense
        and therefor will not appear on the income statement as such.
        Ending retained earnings will match the retained earnings amount listed on the balance sheet for the same period.
        The statement of retained earnings can also be refered to
        as the statement of shareholders' equity or statement of changes in owner's equity.

        <strong>Ending RE = Starting RE + Net Income - Dividends</strong>

        The statement of retained earnings can answer the following questions:
        <ul>
            <li>Is the company profitable?</li>
            <li>How much of the company's net income was distributed to owners?</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
