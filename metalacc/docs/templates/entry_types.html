        Regular Entries
    </p>
    <p>
        A regular journal entry is one that is made to record a normal business transaction.
        Examples of regular journal entries include entries that record sales, record adjustments to inventory, and record expenses.
        Regular journal entries are immediately reflected on all financial statements for the period they are recorded in.

        Adjusting Entries
    </p>
    <p>
        An adjusting journal entry is one made at the end of a period that records revenues/expenses from the current period that have not yet been recognized.
        Typically adjusting entries are cashless.
        Examples of adjusting entries include recording depreciation expense, adjusting prepaid expenses, and splitting up revenue/expenses such that they are allocated to multiple periods.

        Closing Entries
    </p>
    <p>
        A closing journal entry is one made at the end of a period that resets the balance of one or more temporary accounts.
        Closing entries transfer the balance of a temporary account to a permanent account such as retained earnings.
        Closing entries do not increase or decrease the amounts of assets, liabilities, or equity controlled by a company.
