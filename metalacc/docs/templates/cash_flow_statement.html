        Cash Flow Statement
    </p>
    <p>
        The cash flow statement provides a summary of uses and sources of cash for a given period.
        The report illustrates how a company arrived at its end of period cash balance.
        Cash is a particularly important asset because it is the most liquid asset.
        An income statement can show a highly profitable operation, but that doesn't
        necesarily mean the company can continue to operate. The cashflow statement provides transparensy into
        the company's ability to collect funds and pay bills.
    </p>
    <p>
        The cash flow statement breaks uses and sources of cash into 3 main buckets:
        <ul>
            <li>Operating Activities</li>
            <li>Investment Activities</li>
            <li>Financing Activities</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Generally speaking, cash transactions involving equity or liability accounts are financing activities.
        Cash transactions involving fixed assets are investment activities. Cash transactions involving
        current assets can either be operating activities or investment activities.
    </p>

        The cash flow statement provides answers to the following questions:
        <ul>
            <li>Is the company facing liquidity problems now or in the near future?</li>
            <li>What did the company spend its cash on?</li>
            <li>Where did the company get its cash from?</li>
            <li>Are customers paying for goods and services?</li>
