    <p class="heading-2">Liabilities</p>
    <p>
        Liabilites are legal obligations that will require the company to transfer ownership of assets to an outside
        individual or orgnaization at some point in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
        Examples of liabilites include:
        <ul>
            <li>Wages Payable</li>
            <li>Notes Payable</li>
            <li>Taxes Payable</li>
            <li>Interest Payable</li>
            <li>Unearned Revenue</li>
            <li>Long Term Lease Payable</li>
            <li>Bonds Payable</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        A company's liabilities are represented by permanent accounts listed on the balance sheet.
        Liability accounts carry a crebit balance.
        According to the accounting equation, all of a company's liabilites are equal to assets minus equity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Liabilites can be broken down into current and non-current liabilites.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Current liabilites</strong> are liabilites that are expected to be settled during the current reporting
        cycle or year. Examples of current liabilites include wages payable, taxes payable, and unearned revenue
        which will require the company to give up goods or render services during the current reporting cycle or year.
        The principle on a mortgage that is coming due is represented with a current liability account.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Non-current liabilities</strong> are liaiblites that will not require servicing during the current reporting cycle
        or year. Examples of non-current liabilities include bonds payable, notes payable, and mortgage payable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Generally speaking, liabilites provide companies with cash, materials and services needed to operate.
        Unlike equity, liabilites provide these resources without sacrificing ownership. Suppose a company purchases
        a fleet of cars from a dealership and agrees to pay the dealership over several years through a lease agreement.
        Under normal circumstances the car dealership cannot influence any decision making over the company, nor can they
        claim additional assets relative the the success of the company. The trade-off is that the liability does not
        go away if the company fails. Creditors get first dibs on a company's assets should the company go out of
        business and can legally force the liquidation of assets in order to settle debts.
