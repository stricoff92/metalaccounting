    <p class="heading-2">Assets</p>
    <p>
        Assets are resources owned and controlled by a company.
        Assets are expected to yield a future benefit for the company.
    </p>
    <p>
        Examples of assets include:
        <ul>
            <li>Cash</li>
            <li>Office Supplies</li>
            <li>Certificates of Deposit</li>
            <li>Inventory</li>
            <li>Prepaid Expenses</li>
            <li>Receivables</li>
            <li>Property/Plant/Equipment</li>
            <li>Intellectual Property</li>
            <li>Goodwill</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        A company's assets are represented by permanent accounts listed on the balance sheet.
        Asset accounts carry a debit balance. According to the accounting equation, all of a
        company's assets is equal to liabilities plus equity.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Assets =  Liabilities + Equity</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Assets can be broken down into current and fixed assets.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Current assets</strong> are expected
        to yield a benefit during the current reporting cycle or year. Examples of current
        assets include cash, receivables, inventory, and supplies. Typically, current
        assets can be converted into cash within the current period or year.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Fixed assets</strong> or non-current assets are less liquid,
        meaning it requires more time and effort to convert them into cash.
        Examples of fixed assets include long term investments and property/plant/equipment. 
        Fixed assets are expected to yield a benefit further than 1 year into the future.
        A company with billions of dollars in fixed assets can still find itself in trouble
        if it does not have access to liquid assets. A company cannot pay its employees with buildings
        and land.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Contra asset accounts</strong> carry a credit balance.
        These accounts are used to track the depletion of a fixed asset's usefulness over time.
        The fixed asset account is not directly adjusted. Instead, the estimated decrease in value of the asset in question
        is tracked through an associated contra asset account.
        An example of a contra asset account is accumulated depreciation of a building.
        Recording depreciation involves a credit to the depreciation account and a debit to an expense account (depreciation expense).
        A journal entry involving depreciation does not impact a company's cash or liquidity directly, but has a direct impact
        on the income statement and therefor taxes.
    </p>
    <p>
        In accordance with the matching principal, companies are supposed to follow some standard for 
        recording depreciation due to the immediate tax benefit that comes from the cashless expensing.
