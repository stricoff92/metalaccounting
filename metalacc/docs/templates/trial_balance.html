        Trial Balance
    </p>
    <p>
        The trial balance is diagnostic summary that shows all accounts and their balances at a single point in time.
        The trial balance can be split into an unadjusted and adjusted trial balance. An adjusted trial balance
        highlights what (if any) adjusting entries have been made for a given period. Adjusting entries are commonly made to account for
        depreciation or to match revenues & expenses to the correct period.
    </p>
    <p>
        The trial balance can answer the following questions:
        <ul>
            <li>Do debits equal credits?</li>
            <li>What temporary accounts have an outstanding balance?</li>
            <li>What adjusting entries were made?</li>
        </ul>
