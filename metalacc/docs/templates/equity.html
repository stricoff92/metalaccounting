    <p class="heading-2">Equity</p>
    <p>
        Equity represents the owners' share of a company. To put it another way: equity is the owners'
        claims on a company's assets, or the company's net assets. After all of a company's debts (liabilities)
        have been settled, what's left is the equity. Therefor, equity is equal to assets minus liabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Equity = Assets - Liabilities</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Owner's equity is represented by permanent accounts listed on the balance sheet. Equity accounts
        carry a credit balance.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two types of equity: contributed capital, and retained earnings.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Contributed capital</strong> represents resources that owners invest into the company. Examples of
        contributed capital accounts include common stock, and additional paid in capital.
        Contributed capital accounts cannot carry a debit balance.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Retained earnings</strong> are net income (profit) that has not yet been distributed to the owners.
        After a reporting cycle a company can choose to pay out some or all of the profit to the company's owners through a dividend.
        Income that is not distributed collects in a retained earnings account.
        Retained earnings can be invested to fuel growth, or can serve as a rainy-day fund.
        A retained earnings account with a debit balance indicates negative profit. This shows that the company
        has lost money over its lifetime. A company's bylaws dictate how and when dividends are distributed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Equity, or more specifically contributed capital, is similar to a liability in that it
        provides companies with cash, materials, and services needed to operate.
        The difference is that the company trades ownership for these resources. As dictated by the bylaws, individuals with equity
        can exercise influence over decision making and can claim additional assets relative to the success of the company.
        The trade-off is that equity holders are the last to receive assets during liquidation, and
        therefor are likely to lose the most should the company close.
