        Balance Sheet
    </p>
    <p>
        A balance sheet is a snapshot of a company's financial position at a single point in time.
        The balance sheet can also be refered to as the statement of financial position or
        the statement of financial condition.
    </p>
    <p>
        A balance sheet lists the company's permanent accounts: assets, liabilities, and equity.
        The company's lifetime of revenue/expense activities are indirectly shown on the balance sheet through
        the equity section of the report (retained earnings).
    </p>
    <p>
        The balance sheet provides answers to the following questions:
        <ul>
            <li>How liquid is the company?</li>
            <li>How much debt does the company carry?</li>
            <li>How much <em>stuff</em> does the company own?</li>
            <li>How is the company funded? (debt to equity ratio)</li>
            <li>How much have owners invested into the company?</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
