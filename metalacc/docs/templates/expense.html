        Expense
    </p>
    <p>
        Expenses represent the cost of depleted assets as well as the cost of supporting operations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Expense accounts are temporary accounts that are reported on the income statement. Expense accounts normally
        carry a debit balance. During a reporting cycle a company conducts its business and recognizes expenses
        by debiting expense accounts. At the end of the reporting cycle, expense accounts are closed along with other
        temporary accounts. The difference between a company's revenues (credit balance) and expenses (debit balance) is net income.
        This difference is permanantly preserved by either debiting or crediting the retained earnings account with a plug entry.
        When closing out temporary accounts, an excess in revenues will result in a credit adjustment to retained earnings,
        where as an excess in expenses will result in a debit adjustment to retained earnings.

        <strong>Operating expenses</strong> are incurred in support of a company's normal day to day operating activities.
        Operating expenses are subtracted from operating revenues to calculate operating income. Examples of operating expense accounts include:
        <ul>
            <li>Wages Expense</li>
            <li>Cost of Goods Sold</li>
            <li>Rent Expense</li>
            <li>Insurance Expense</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Cost of goods sold</strong> (CoGS), or more generally: cost of sales, is an operating expense account that represents
        cost of merchandise sold, and other expenses directly associated with selling. Cost of goods sold is subtracted from
        sales revenue to calculate gross profit. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Non-operating Expenses</strong> are expenses incured that are not associated with the core activities of a business.
        Non-operating expenses could be considered one-off expenses that are not expected to be repeated.
        Examples of non-operating expenses include: 
        <ul>
            <li>Legal fees from a lawsuit</li>
            <li>Penalty fees</li>
            <li>Loss on sale of property/plant/equipment</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
