        Revenue
    </p>
    <p>
        Revenues represent inflows of resources from earning activities.
    </p>
    <p>
        Revenue accounts are temporary accounts that are reported on the income statement. Revenue accounts normally
        carry a credit balance. During a reporting cycle a company conducts its business and recognizes revenue
        by crediting revenue accounts. At the end of the reporting cycle, revenue accounts are closed along with other
        temporary accounts. The difference between a company's revenues (credit balance) and expenses (debit balance) is net income.
        This difference is permanantly preserved by either debiting or crediting the retained earnings account with a plug entry.
        When closing out temporary accounts, an excess in revenues will result in a credit adjustment to retained earnings,
        where as an excess in expenses will result in a debit adjustment to retained earnings.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Operating revenues</strong> are earned through the normal day to day operations of a company.
        Operating revenue counts towards operating income.
        Examples of operating revenues include:
        <ul>
            <li>Sales Revenue</li>
            <li>Consulting Revenue</li>
            <li>Interest Revenue</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Non-Operating Revenues</strong> are incidentally earned and not a core part of the business.
        These revenues do not contribute to operating income.
        An example of non-operating revenue would be when a contruction company sells equipment to the salvage yard for more
        than the book value of the equipment (fixed asset balance minus accumulated depreciation). The difference between
        the cash received and the net value of the equipment would be recorded as a credit plug to a <em>gains</em> account.
        Misclassifying non-operating revenues as operating can mislead financial statement users and, depending on intent, could constitute fraud.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Contra Revenue</strong> accounts carry a debit balance and are similar to expenses in that they ultimately reduce retained earnings.
        Contra revenue accounts are considered to be a subtraction from revenues rather than an expense, and are therefor reported
        as a negative revenue on the income statement. Examples of contra revenue accounts include:
        <ul>
            <li>Sales Returns and Allowances</li>
            <li>Sales Discounts</li>
        </ul>

    </p>
